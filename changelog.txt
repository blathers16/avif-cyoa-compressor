1.0 - initial release

2.0 -   cleaned up some code
        added some comments
        added more type annotations
        now converts GIFs
            animated GIFs are converted to animated webp images
            static GIFs are converted to AVIF
        added a benchmark for the one sample cyoa that had a GIFs
        removed some files I forgot to delete
        added this changelog

3.0 -   more code cleanup
        progressbar, tracks progress of actual dataurls
        quality setting, passed directly to the cq parameter of the encoder
            the encoder is libavif, I believe, but am not sure, that aom is the actual encoder being used
        better styling
        input and output size in megabytes or kilobytes depending on file size
        elapsed encoding time using performance.now
        uses the original image if it is somehow smaller than the converted image (probably only possible if you used silly quality settings)
        file picker can be reset to upload the same image again (for instance with different quality settings)
        cancelling the file select still preserves your last result

3.1 -   file select no longer allows selecting multiple files despite being unable to process more than one file
        now detects animated webp images and no longer converts them to static AVIF
        updated build process
        removed wasm files from git
